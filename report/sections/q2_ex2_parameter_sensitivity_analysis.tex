\section{Parameter Sensitivity Analysis }

In the previous exercise, we observed that the fox population went extinct in 6 out of 100 simulation runs. In this section, I aim to identify the conditions under which the fox population can be sustained more consistently. To do this, I selected a key parameter to vary and recorded the system's behavior in response.

The primary cause of fox extinction appears to be a shortage of rabbits, which in turn is often caused by a lack of grass, the main food source for rabbits. Therefore, I decided to vary the \texttt{growrate} parameter of the environment, which controls how many new grass units are added to the grid in each iteration. By increasing the grow rate, I aim to assess whether more abundant grass leads to larger rabbit populations, and subsequently, to better survival conditions for foxes.
